I can be referred to as `shuncleopasfang`, `Shun Fang`, `方順`, `Juntaro Ogata`, and `緒方 順太郎`. The Japanese name `Juntaro Ogata (緒方 順太郎)`, chosen based on a Japanese friend's suggestion, incorporates elements of my Chinese name `Shun Fang (方順)`. I prefer to display my name as `Juntaro Ogata` in most situations.

I am interested in multi-modal foundation models. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae]().

I focus on politics, particularly in Japan-Taiwan-China relations. My political enlightenment was influenced by Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je, the 2024 Taiwan presidential election candidate, and this is a [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNDMhoABacYMNcLuC9hYBRy1a_Ciz7TT/view) of us taken on October 15, 2023, along with his [birthday wishes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1arKZkCC08v2FqETwg5MMa5_P80GuMrqF/view) for me. On the eve of the Blue-White Alliance political consultation meeting between the Kuomintang and the Taiwan People's Party, we embraced and took another commemorative [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HKwt3E8LJOGD9yqHhOsr2GPRyXsts1CO/view) together, with my suggestion and hope that the opposition presidential candidates reach a consensus to proceed with cooperation.

I have been training in Table Tennis since childhood and received coaching from Wu Jingping at the Huangshan Training Base, a former coach of the Chinese national table tennis team and the mentor of Olympic champion Fan Zhendong, and here is a [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mlsRmwy2KXKgoCAtxQwmF9Z5AQ8zmjK/view) of us taken after a multi-ball training session. I have written Chinese Calligraphy since the age of six, here is my [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lL25tWxkg-ZBGNv9J-cvxl3pUnct07SU). I'm keeping a [diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn2rebU6vVxZDhbR59W16ho5bSymMQhY1yFdLFMlqW0/pub) in Chinese.
