<br>

I can be referred to as `shuncleopasfang`, `Shun Fang`, `æ–¹é †`, `Juntaro Ogata` and `ç·’æ–¹ é †å¤ªéƒŽ`. The Japanese name, `Juntaro Ogata (ç·’æ–¹ é †å¤ªéƒŽ)`, was thoughtfully crafted based on the suggestion of a Japanese friend, skillfully incorporating elements of my Chinese name, `Shun Fang (æ–¹é †)`, into its structure.

<br>

Currently I am a senior majoring in Information and Computing Science at Anhui University and previously studied as an exchange student in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, focusing on knowledge graphs and mitigating hallucinations in language models. I'm preparing for the winter 2025 admissions in Data Science at Kyoto University and the NLP program at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.

Beyond academics, I actively participate in various activities and societies. I played table tennis for both the Anhui University and Feng Chia University Table Tennis Teams, competing in tournaments such as the 21st Tamkang Cup National College Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in New Taipei City and the 2023 Tumu Sports Cup Anhui Provincial Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in Hefei. I also served as President of the Anhui University Chunhui Club from September 2022 to June 2023, leading the largest non-profit volunteer organization on campus, which had 249 official members during my tenure. My commitment to social services includes volunteering as a teacher aiding education at Fanzhai School in Jieshou, Anhui, and later returning as the team leader for the rural education aid group. By the way, I completed a half marathon in 01:58:09 at the Hefei Marathon in December 2021, and I began learning Chinese Calligraphy at the age of seven.

<br>

Additionally, I have a keen interest in politics, particularly in Cross-Strait Relations. My political enlightenment was inspired by Ko Wen-je; on my birthday in 2023, I met him in person, and he wished me a happy birthday. On the eve of the Blue-White Alliance, we embraced and took a photo together.
