I can be referred to as `shuncleopasfang`, `Shun Fang`, `æ–¹é †`, `Juntaro Ogata`, and `ç·’æ–¹ é †å¤ªéƒŽ`. The Japanese name `Juntaro Ogata (ç·’æ–¹ é †å¤ªéƒŽ)`, chosen based on a Japanese friend's suggestion, incorporates elements of my Chinese name `Shun Fang (æ–¹é †)`. I prefer to display my name as `Juntaro Ogata` in most situations.

Currently I am an undergraduate senior majoring in Information and Computing Science at Anhui University in China and previously studied as an exchange student in Computer Science and Information Engineering at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. A significant factor in choosing to apply as an exchange student to this university was inspired by Bo Li, the current leader of UIUC Secure Learning Lab, who had a similar exchange student experience at the same university in Taiwan many years ago. I am interested in frontend designing and machine learning, with a focus on efficient large language models with sub-quadratic complexity. I am presently preparing my undergraduate thesis with the tentative topic "Time-series Prediction based on xLSTM", which leverages exponential gating and modified memory structures to boost capabilities and perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling. And I am preparing for admission to graduate schools in Japan for the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 terms.

I actively participate in various activities and societies during my undergraduate life. I served as President of the Anhui University Chunhui Club, the largest non-profit volunteer organization on campus, with 249 official members during my tenure from September 2022 to June 2023. Based on my role as the club president, I led teams conducting long-term rural teaching aid projects in impoverished areas during the summers of 2022 and 2023. In addition, I represented both Anhui University and Feng Chia University Table Tennis Teams, competing in tournaments such as the 21st Tamkang Cup National College Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in New Taipei City and the 2023 Tumu Sports Cup Anhui Provincial Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in Hefei. By the way, I completed the Half Marathon in 01:58:09 at the Hefei Marathon 2021 & China National Marathon Championship (Hefei Station) in December 2021.

I focus on politics, particularly in Japan-Taiwan-China relations. My political enlightenment was influenced by Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je, the 2024 Taiwan presidential election candidate, and this is a [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNDMhoABacYMNcLuC9hYBRy1a_Ciz7TT/view) of us taken on October 15, 2023, along with his [birthday wishes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1odAayKZWJjTdYFDNo1ajwatOb7xpYK0k/view) for me. On the eve of the Blue-White Alliance political consultation meeting between the Kuomintang and the Taiwan People's Party, we embraced and took another commemorative [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HKwt3E8LJOGD9yqHhOsr2GPRyXsts1CO/view) together, with my suggestion and hope that the opposition presidential candidates reach a consensus to proceed with cooperation.

I have written Chinese Calligraphy since the age of seven, here is my [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lL25tWxkg-ZBGNv9J-cvxl3pUnct07SU). I'm keeping a [diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn2rebU6vVxZDhbR59W16ho5bSymMQhY1yFdLFMlqW0/pub) in Chinese, recording my daily life. For the future, I seek opportunities to develop my research taste, engineering skills, and political insight to gain more influence and impact people.
