I can be referred to as `shuncleopasfang`, `Shun Fang`, `æ–¹é †`, `Juntaro Ogata` and `ç·’æ–¹ é †å¤ªéƒŽ`. The Japanese name, `Juntaro Ogata (ç·’æ–¹ é †å¤ªéƒŽ)`, was thoughtfully crafted based on the suggestion of a Japanese friend, skillfully incorporating elements of my Chinese name, `Shun Fang (æ–¹é †)`, into its structure.

<br>

Currently I am a senior majoring in Information and Computing Science at Anhui University and previously studied as an exchange student in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, in particular Knowledge Graph and Language Agents. I am preparing for admission to Japanese graduate school for the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 terms.

<br>

Beyond academics, I have a keen interest in politics, particularly in Cross-strait relations. My political enlightenment was inspired by Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je, and this is a [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNDMhoABacYMNcLuC9hYBRy1a_Ciz7TT/view) of us taken on October 15, 2023, along with his [birthday wishes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1odAayKZWJjTdYFDNo1ajwatOb7xpYK0k/view) for me. On the eve of the Blue-White Alliance political consultation meeting between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) to be held at the Ma Ying-jeou Foundation, we embraced and took another commemorative [photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HKwt3E8LJOGD9yqHhOsr2GPRyXsts1CO/view) together. Apart from these, my other political engagements are private information.

<br>

Additionally, I actively participate in various activities and societies. I represented both Anhui University and Feng Chia University Table Tennis Teams, competing in tournaments such as the 21st Tamkang Cup National College Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in New Taipei City and the 2023 Tumu Sports Cup Anhui Provincial Table Tennis Invitational Tournament in Hefei. I served as President of the Anhui University Chunhui Club, the largest non-profit volunteer organization on campus, with 249 official members during my tenure from September 2022 to June 2023. Passionate about volunteer work in impoverished areas, I served as a rural volunteer teacher at Fanzhai School in Jieshou, Fuyang, Anhui, China from June to July 2022; the following summer, I returned as the team leader of the rural education aid group from July to August 2023, continuing to support educational efforts in the region. By the way, I completed the Half Marathon in 01:58:09 at the Hefei Marathon 2021 & China National Marathon Championship (Hefei Station) in December 2021; and I have been practicing Chinese Calligraphy since the age of seven, here is my [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lL25tWxkg-ZBGNv9J-cvxl3pUnct07SU).

<br>

I'm keeping a [diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn2rebU6vVxZDhbR59W16ho5bSymMQhY1yFdLFMlqW0/pub) in Chinese, recording my daily life. For the future, I am constantly seeking opportunities to cultivate research taste, engineering skills, and political insight, while enabling me to positively impact people and the world.
